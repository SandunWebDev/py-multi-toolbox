**On this branch ("study" Branch),**

-   This task codes are originally for, Course certification Projects of` FreecodeCamp's "Sceientific Computing with Python" Course Certification Projects. [LINK](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python)
-   In here, I have followed some different structures to study some other things along with it. (Ex. Liniting, Prettyfying, Pacakge Import Handling, Poetry, Etc...)
-   Each course project is structured into its own Pacakage/Module.
    -   Arithmatic Formatter (arithmaticArranger Package)
    -   Time Calculator (timeCaclulator Package)
    -   Budget App (budgetExplorer Package)
    -   Polygon Area Calculator (polygonHandler Pacakage)
    -   Probability Calculator (probability Pacakage)
    -
    -   "pythonscientificcompcourse" Package is the MAIN package of this project. (Mainly EntryPoint) It used to run other modules, specify CLI app things, etc...
-   Simplest way to run things is to follow below steps.
    -   poetry install
    -   poetry run task dev
-   In other branches (Mainly devlopment & main), I am going to add, change, improve things top of this.
