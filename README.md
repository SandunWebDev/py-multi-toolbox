**On this branch ("study" Branch),**

- This task codes are originally for, Course certification Projects of` FreecodeCamp's "Sceientific Computing with Python" Course Certification Projects. [LINK](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python)
- In here, I have followed some different structures to study some other things along with it. (Ex. Liniting, Prettyfying, Pacakge Import Handling, Poetry, Etc...)
- Each course project is structured into its own Pacakage/Module.
  - Arithmatic Formatter (arithmaticArranger Package)
  - Time Calculator (timeCaclulator Package)
  - Budget App (budgetExplorer Package)
  - Polygon Area Calculator (polygonHandler Pacakage)
  - Probability Calculator (probability Pacakage)
  -
  - "pythonscientificcompcourse" Package is the MAIN package of this project. (Mainly EntryPoint) It used to run other modules, specify CLI app things, etc...
- Simplest way to run things is to follow below steps.
  - poetry install
  - poetry run task dev
- In other branches (Mainly devlopment & main), I am going to add, change, improve things top of this.
